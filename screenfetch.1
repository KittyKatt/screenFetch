.SH NAME
screenFetch \- The Bash Screenshot Information Tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B screenfetch \fR[OPTIONAL FLAGS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This handy Bash script can be used to generate one of those
nifty terminal theme information + ASCII distribution logos you
see in everyone's screenshots nowadays. It will auto-detect your
distribution and display an ASCII version of that distribution's
logo and some valuable information to the right. There are options
to specify no ascii art, colors, taking a screenshot upon displaying
info, and even customizing the screenshot command!
This script is very easy to add to and can easily be extended.
