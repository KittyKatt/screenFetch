**##** *#* TO DO LIST *#* **##**

This small list will be the central place where I will list ideas and 
things I want to happen with screenFetch.

- Needs to fix uptime bug and make it work more solid.

~ WM's that still need to be supported:
   - ?

~ Would like to add more distributions. If anyone has any distributions that they would 
   like to add to screenfetch, let me know.

~ I'd also like to have working, universal shell type detection. Would be awesome.

That's about it for now. If you can help with any of these, please 
please PLEASE let me know by emailing me at kittykatt@kittykatt.us or by 
stopping by SilverIRC on your favorite IRC client. The network can be 
accessed by pointing your IRC client to kittykatt.silverirc.com. #me0wz 
is my home channel. If you don't have an IRC client, head on over to 
http://www.silverirc.com/index.php?page=chat and that'll join 
you to #randomz, where I can be reached as well.

Thank you for any help.
