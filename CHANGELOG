v2.1.3 (HOLY SHIT BIG CHANGES)
  - Added shitload of new features. Keep reading.
  - Added function to set script variables on commandline execution. (i.e. screenfetch-dev -o 'baseurl="http://www.example.com"')
  - Added function to set display info on commandline execution. (i.i. screenfetch-dev -d 'Host, OS, Kernel, Uptime, Theme, Icons')
  - Added function to export theme if wanted upon execution. Currently only supports the following window managers:  PekWM, OpenBox, BlackBox, FluxBox, Metacity (kind of), Xfwm4 (kind of).
    This is a really big addition, and quite experimental. Things that are currently sought out and exported are the following:  GTK Theme Folder, Icon Theme Folder, WM Theme Folder, Background
    Image, and screenshot taken by screenfetch. If you would like anything else exported with this let me know and I'll see what I can do.
  - Added function to upload screenshot taken to server you have ssh access on after info is displayed. MUST set baseurl, serveraddr, and serverdir variables for this to work. See -o flag.
  - Added new support for detecting the following window managers:  Musca, i3, Ratpoison, wmii, Wmfs, ScrotWM, and Beryl.
  - Attempted to fix XFCE detection by limiting the processes that result in XFCE to only "xfce4-desktop". Dunno if this will work or not. Email me.
  - Added function to detect hostname and user. Displayed in info output.
  - Added function to detect resolution. Displayed in info output. Untested, and possibly not working, on multiple monitor setups. Email me.
  - Added function to detect working shell. Might also add function to detect terminal type in the future.
  - Fixed bug in GNOME background output. Was outputing entire pathname. Now only outputs the filename of the image.
  - Replaced old Arch Linux logo with new updated one. Don't really like the new one, but it was popular demand. Old one is still available through -D with the 'Arch Linux - Old' argument for
    those of us that are old school.

 .... oh shit didn't update this ....

v1.8.4
 - Added experimental Compiz detection (WM and theme)
 - Added experimental StumpWM detection (Just WM). Thanks to gtklocker for this part.

v1.8.3
 - Added the groundwork for background support, terminal width detection (and thus truncating upon being over this width), and a couple other things I can't remember at the moment.
 - Gonna update a couple of the ASCII arts. :D

v1.7.9
 - Added support to DETECT the following window managers: dwm, awesome, and WindowMaker
 - Added support for lighter backgrounds. If you have a lighter background, specify -l as a flag on the command-line. This will turn all white output to dark gray output.
 - screenFetch was featured in the ALM (Arch Linux Magazine)! The issue can be found
   and downloaded at http://www.archlinux.org/static/magazine/2010/ALM-2010-Apr.pdf

v1.7.7
 - Added FVWM support per request of goran'agar on the Arch forums.

v1.7.6.5
 - Fixed broken -s flag to take screenshot.
 - Put calling for verbose function back into other functions.

v1.7.6 (important)
 - Working distribution detection! Most of the distributions I've included have been untested as of yet. Which means I could REALLY use some testers 
for these distros. The ones that still need testing are as follows: SUSE, Mandriva/Mandrake, Gentoo, Fedora, Red Hat Linux, and BSD. If you would like 
to help test these distributions, let me know by emailing me at kittykatt@archlinux.us
 - Reworked a lot of the code to be functions instead of repeating parts. Looks a lot cleaner now.
 - This update was mainly Kingdomcome's doing. So thank him profusely.

v1.7.5 (HUGE)
 - Massive rewrite, cleaning up a huge portion of the code.
 - Made several repeating parts of the code into functions.
 - Learned getopts. Rewrote flag support with it. Flags now supported are as follows:
    ~ -D 'DISTRO NAME'   Specify distribution name
    ~ -c 'command'    Specify custom screenshot command.
    ~ -V    Print current version of script.
    ~ -v    Turn on verbose output.
    ~ -s    Take screenshot.
    ~ -n    Display info only and no ASCII logo.
    ~ -h    Display help menu.
 - Added version number to DE reporting. Except LXDE. Because they fail.
 - Thanks to h2 for many, many, many suggestions and a lot of help. This update would most likely not have been possible without him.

v1.4.5
 - Cleaned up WM Theme detection code.

v1.4.4
 - Changed version system
 - Fixed if statement for "Not Present" or "LXDE" DE (Thanks to 
ArcherSeven for pointing it out)

 - Implemented LXDE support (Yay!)
 - Discussed ideas for "united" DE detection

v1.3
 - Added some flag support (notably --version, --screen, and --help)
 - Added commented lines for --distro and --command flags (future use)
 - Fixed another color escape sequence.

v1.2
