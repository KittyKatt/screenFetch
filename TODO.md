**##** *#* TO DO LIST *#* **##**

This small list will be the central place where I will list ideas and
things I want to happen with screenFetch.

Obvious Things:

	1) Add any and all suggested WMs.
	2) More distros! Suggest them and I'll add them. Or I'll add them as I find them.

Other Things:

	1) Better GTK3 detection. Fix for gsettings stuff.
	2) Better -c. Support setting of all available colors in an ascii logo.
	3) Centralized color setting. c{1,2,3,etc} and lablecolors all set in one place.
	4) Better disk detection. Fix problems with it.
	5) Cleanup detectuptime, detectcpu, *
	6) Custom logos file. Source logos file with -C flag is present. -A will act normally
	   if -C is present as well.

That's about it for now. If you can help with any of these, please
please PLEASE let me know by emailing me at kittykatt@kittykatt.us or by
stopping by SilverIRC on your favorite IRC client. The network can be
accessed by pointing your IRC client to kittykatt.silverirc.com. #me0wz
is my home channel. If you don't have an IRC client, head on over to
http://www.silverirc.com/index.php?page=chat and that'll join
you to #randomz, where I can be reached as well.

Thank you for any help.
