screenFetch - The Bash Screenshot Information Tool
===============

What is screenFetch?
---------------------

screenFetch is a "Bash Screenshot Information Tool". This handy Bash 
script can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal theme 
information + ASCII distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots
nowadays. It will auto-detect your distribution and display an ASCII
version of that distribution's logo and some valuable information to the
right. There are options to specify no ascii art, colors, taking a
screenshot upon displaying info, and even customizing the screenshot
command! This script is very easy to add to and can easily be extended.


How do I get screenFetch?
---------------------
Arch Linux
============
1. Install `screenfetch-git` or `screenfetch` from the AUR. That's it!

2. In a terminal, make the file executable by doing the following: `chmod +x /path/to/screenfetch/screenfetch-dev`
3. Then, either keep it there, or move it to somewhere in your $PATH to make it available without having to use the full path to the script.


Running screenfetch
------------------------

To run screenFetch, open a terminal of some sort and type in the command `screenFetch`
or wherever you saved the script to. This will generate an ascii logo with the 
information printed to the side of the logo. There are some options that may be
specifiedon the command line, and those are shown below or by executing `screenFetch -h`:

        -v              Verbose output.
        -n              Do no display ASCII distribution logo.
        -s              Using this flag tells the script that you want it to
                        take a screenshot.
        -l              Specify that you have a light background. This 
                        turns all white text into dark gray text (in ascii
                        logos and in information output).
        -c 'COMMAND'    Here you can specify a custom screenshot command for
                        the script to execute. Surrounding quotes are required.
        -D 'DISTRO'     Here you can specify your distribution for the script
                        to use. Surrounding quotes are required.
        -V              Display current script version.
        -h              Display this help.
