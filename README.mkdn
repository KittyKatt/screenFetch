# screenFetch - The Bash Screenshot Information Tool

## What is screenFetch?

screenFetch is a "Bash Screenshot Information Tool". This handy Bash
script can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal theme
information + ASCII distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots
nowadays. It will auto-detect your distribution and display an ASCII
version of that distribution's logo and some valuable information to the
right. There are options to specify no ascii art, colors, taking a
screenshot upon displaying info, and even customizing the screenshot
command! This script is very easy to add to and can easily be extended.

## Running screenfetch

To run screenFetch, open a terminal of some sort and type in the command `screenFetch`
or wherever you saved the script to. This will generate an ascii logo with the
information printed to the side of the logo. There are some options that may be
specifiedon the command line, and those are shown below or by executing `screenFetch -h`:

      -v                 Verbose output.
      -o 'OPTIONS'       Allows for setting script variables on the
                         command line. Must be in the following format...
                         'OPTION1="OPTIONARG1";OPTION2="OPTIONARG2"'
      -n                 Do not display ASCII distribution logo.
      -N                 Strip all color from output.
      -t                 Truncate output based on terminal width (Experimental!).
      -s(m)(u)           Using this flag tells the script that you want it
                         to take a screenshot. Use the -m flag if you would like
                         to move it to a new location afterwards. Use the -u flag
                         if you would like to upload the screenshot to teknik.io.
      -c string          You may change the outputted colors with -c. The format is
                         as follows: [0-9][0-9],[0-9][0-9]. The first argument controls the
                         ASCII logo colors and the label colors. The second argument
                         controls the colors of the information found. One argument may be
                         used without the other.
      -S 'COMMAND'       Here you can specify a custom screenshot command for
                         the script to execute. Surrounding quotes are required.
      -D 'DISTRO'        Here you can specify your distribution for the script
                         to use. Surrounding quotes are required.
      -A 'DISTRO'        Here you can specify the distribution art that you want
                         displayed. This is for when you want your distro
                         detected but want to display a different logo.
      -E                 Suppress output of errors.
      -V                 Display current script version.
      -h                 Display this help.
